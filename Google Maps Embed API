//find piont of origin through reverse geocoding (JSON) and extend rectangle
//Examine the square footage of area A. Calculate the amount of energy produced using recent industry standars 
//After finding value, extend rectangle by checking boxes around A in a gridlike fashion
	//use bounds of rectangle to cycle through points by utilizng logitude, latitude, and reverse goecoding
//Determine number of buildings in each square
	//seperate into commercial, residential, and industrial giving different average scores (check JSON reverse geocoding API with its labels)
 //if number of buildings is sufficient, the grid is labelled as useful. If not, it is discarded as the low amount of buildings stresses a low amount of need for energy
//having found necessary grids, turn the grids into circles for aesthetic appeal branching out from center
//have teh external option to choose between solar, wind, and nuclear
	//nuclear looks at the data gathered for the grids determining if there is enough open space around it to build
//Display visuals to user
